# Moon GLSL shaders

---

These shaders can be used in FlightGear's Eartview to replace the ones
of the Earth. This hack allows you to fly over a very higly resolved
Moon, as seen by the LROC satellite :)

To generate the textures, see
[**LROC2FGearthview**](https://github.com/eatdust/LROC2FGearthview).
